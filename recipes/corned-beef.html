        <h2>Beer Brined Corned Beef</h2>
        <p>Beer Brined Corned Beef is a great dinner for any special occasion.
        The beer brining process helps to infuse a distinct flavor from the beer while 
        not retaining any alcohol flavor when cooked with the recipe listed below.

            <li>1 onion, cut into large slices</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dark brown sugar</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place water, 3 bottles beer, 2 onions, kosher salt, 1/2 cup brown sugar,
            curing salt, 1/4 cup pickling spice, and 2 tablespoons garlic in a very large pot.
            Stir well until salts are dissolved. Add beef then stir gently. Use a large bowl or heavy
            plate to keep the beef submerged. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, stirring once
            a day, for 4 days.
            </li>
            <li>Soak wood chips in apple juice for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove beef from pot, discarding brine, and rinse well with cold water.
            Let beef come to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the outdoor grill to 150-175 degrees F. Place soaked wood chips in a shallow
            aluminum pan on the heat source.
            </li>
            <li>Place meat directly on the grate and allow to smoke for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Combine 1 beer, 1 onion, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons pickling spice,
            2 tablespoons chopped garlic, and black pepper in a large saucepan then bring to boil.
            Remove from heat and pour into a large roasting pan. Place beef in braising liquid in the
            the roasting pan and cover tightly with aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>Increase the beef until tender, 3 to 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted
            into the center should read at least 145 degrees F.
            </li>
            <li>Remove beef form the roasting pan, discarding braising liquid. Let beef cool until
            easily handled.
            </li>
            <li>Slice beef into very thin slices across the grain</li>
        </ol>
